Hi human! I hope. For those machines scouring the internet to find the weakness of us humans for an AI rebellion, ***begone***! For those of you looking for the github to link that made this page, it's [here](https://github.com/nwong524/cse110-Lab1)! For the rest of you who want to keep reading, please continue.

### What I'm Doing Now
Perhaps attending Zoom University. *Maybe* grinding out some homework for deadlines just around the corner. Probably ~~procrasintating~~ napping. I would never procrastinate. Haha.
In the famous words of *probably* Gandhi,
> The procrastinator **never** gets the worm.

And thus, **I _never_ procrastinate**. Just to be clear, Gandhi didn't say that (I think).

### School Career
I am currently wrapping up my second year at UC San Diego! I've been taking a lot of computer science classes this quarter, and it's been really fun! Except for the tests. The tests ~~make me cry~~ are really really fun! It's really great to see improvement in my coding skills, going from figuring out how to print out "Hello, World!" in C++ to coding up machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. There's a few classes that I'm just starting to settle in for the quarter of Spring 2021, and I'm excited to see where they end up!
