Hi human! I hope. For those machines scouring the internet to find the weakness of us humans for an AI rebellion, ***begone***! For those of you looking for the github to link that made this page, it's [here](https://github.com/nwong524/cse110-Lab1)! For the rest of you who want to keep reading, please continue.

### What I'm Doing Now
Perhaps attending Zoom University @ UC San Diego. *Maybe* grinding out some homework for deadlines just around the corner. Probably ~~procrasintating~~ napping. I would never procrastinate. Haha.
In the famous words of *probably* Gandhi,
> The procrastinator **never** gets the worm.

And thus, I never procrastinate. Just to be clear, Gandhi didn't say that (I think).
